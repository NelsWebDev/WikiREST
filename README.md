# WikiREST

**This is an ongoing project which I attempt to build a simple REST like API without the complexity of using an OAuth Library.** 

Sometimes you just want to store textual data without having to setup a complex database structure. While the featureset will be complex, within a couple minutes, front end developers can easily send and receive data via a simple POST or GET request. No complex headers or API keys needed. 

### Work in progress

Note: This is an ongoing side project that I plan on doing in my spare time. Please do not use this software until alerted to do so.
